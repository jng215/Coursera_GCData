Coursera - Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the processes to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

The source data used by this project is the UCI HAR dataset with the URL link below:
- https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

Futher information about the source data can be obtained in the URL below:
- http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

After downloading and importing the source data, the R script run_analysis.R does the following:
- Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
- Creates an independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The tidy data set, tidyAverageData.txt, and the R script can be obtained in the Github repo link below:
- https://github.com/jng215/Coursera_GCData

There is a CodeBook.md file that describes the variables in the tidy data set.

Thank you.
